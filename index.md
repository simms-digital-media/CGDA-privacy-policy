</ul>
<h2>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION? </h2>

<p><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>We only process  your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid  legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your  consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or  fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our  legitimate business interests.</em></p>
<h3>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you. </h3>

<p>The General Data  Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal  bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may  rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consent.&nbsp;</strong>We may process       your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use       your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your       consent at any time. Click&nbsp;<a href="#withdrawconsent">here</a>&nbsp;to learn       more. </li>
  <li><strong>Legitimate       Interests.</strong>&nbsp;We may process your information when we believe it is       reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and       those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and       freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some       of the purposes described in order to: </li>
  <li>Develop and display  personalized and relevant advertising content for our users </li>
  <li>Analyze how our  services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users </li>
  <li><strong>Legal       Obligations.</strong>&nbsp;We may process your information where we believe it is       necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate       with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal       rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we       are involved.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Vital       Interests.</strong>&nbsp;We may process your information where we believe it is       necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a       third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety       of any person. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>If you are located  in Canada, this section applies to you.</em></strong></p>
<p>We may process your  information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to  use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where  your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your  consent at any time. Click&nbsp;<a href="#withdrawconsent">here</a>&nbsp;to learn  more. </p>
<p>In some exceptional  cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your  information without your consent, including, for example: </p>
<ul>
  <li>If collection       is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be       obtained in a timely way </li>
  <li>For       investigations and fraud detection and prevention </li>
  <li>For business       transactions provided certain conditions are met </li>
  <li>If it is       contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to       assess, process, or settle an insurance claim </li>
  <li>For       identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next       of kin </li>
  <li>If we have       reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim       of financial abuse </li>
  <li>If it is       reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the       availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is       reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement       or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province </li>
  <li>If disclosure       is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of       the court relating to the production of records </li>
  <li>If it was       produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or       profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which       the information was produced </li>
  <li>If the       collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes </li>
  <li>If the       information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM  DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;We may share  information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the  following&nbsp;third parties.</em></p>
<p><strong>Vendors,  Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers.</strong>&nbsp;We may share  your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents  (“<strong>third parties</strong>”) who perform services for us or on our behalf and  require access to such information to do that work.&nbsp;We have contracts in  place with our third parties, which are designed to help safeguard your  personal information. This means that they cannot do anything with your  personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will also  not share your personal information with any organization apart from us. They  also commit to protect the data they hold on our behalf and to retain it for  the period we instruct.&nbsp;The&nbsp;third parties we may share personal information  with are as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Advertising,       Direct Marketing, and Lead Generation</strong></li>

<h2>5. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES? </h2>

<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;We are not  responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third parties  that we may link to or who advertise on our Services, but are not affiliated  with, our Services.</em></p>
<p>The Services may  link to third-party websites, online services, or mobile applications and/or  contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and  which may link to other websites, services, or applications. Accordingly, we do  not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we will not be  liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites,  services, or applications. The inclusion of a link towards a third-party  website, service, or application does not imply an endorsement by us. We cannot  guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any  data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are  not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies  of any third parties, including other websites, services, or applications that  may be linked to or from the Services. You should review the policies of such  third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions. </p>
<h2>6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION? </h2>

<p><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>We keep your  information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this  privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
<p>We will only keep  your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set  out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or  permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No  purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for  longer than&nbsp;2 years. </p>
<p>When we have no  ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will  either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for  example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives),  then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any  further processing until deletion is possible. </p>
<h2>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE? </h2>

<p><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>We aim to protect  your personal information through a system of organizational and technical  security measures.</em></p>
<p>We have implemented  appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures  designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.  However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no  electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can  be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that  hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able  to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your  information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,  transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own  risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment. </p>
<h2>8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS? </h2>

<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;In some  regions, such as&nbsp;the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK),  and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over  your personal information.&nbsp;You may review, change, or terminate your  account at any time.</em></p>
<p>In some regions  (like&nbsp;the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable  data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and  obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or  erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and  (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also  have the right to object to the processing of your personal information.

You can find their contact details here:&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm" target="_blank">https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>&nbsp;(opens in a new tab). </p>

You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact  details provided in the section &quot;<a href="#contact">HOW CAN  YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>&quot; below. </p>
<p>However, please  note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its  withdrawal, nor&nbsp;when applicable law allows,&nbsp;will it affect the  processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing  grounds other than consent. </p>
<p>If you have  questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us  at&nbsp;cgda.app@gmail.com. </p>
<h2>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES </h2>

<p>Most web browsers  and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a  Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal  your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities  monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for  recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not  currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that  automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard  for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will  inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice. </p>
<h2>10. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS? </h2>

<h4>Verification  process</h4>
<p>Upon receiving your  request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same  person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification  efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it  with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on  the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information  so that we can match the information you provide with the information we  already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method  (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use  other verification methods as the circumstances dictate. </p>
<p>We will only use  personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or  authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting  additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if  we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us,  we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of  verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will  delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying  you. </p>

  <li>You may       request to opt out from future selling of your personal information to       third parties.
